# webGui.js

This is a fairly simple JavaScript library I made to assist in creating HTML pages with raw JavaScript.


## Documentation

Here's the low down on using this library!

### Global things

**print** is now the same as *console.log*
So you can do 
```js
print("Hello world!");
```
and it would be the same as 
```js
console.log("Hello world!");
```
